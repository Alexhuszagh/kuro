Kuro is an unofficial, featureful, open source, community-driven, free Microsoft To-Do app for Linux, made by [David Morais](https://dsmorais.com)

Kuro is a fork of [Ao](https://github.com/klaussinani/ao) which is no longer actively maintained

### Installation
Head over to the [releases ðŸš€](https://github.com/davidsmorais/kuro/releases) page and download your distribution's package.

* **Do not request new package types**. You can submit the PR or an [issue](https://github.com/davidsmorais/kuro/issues) to have them built.

### Bug or Feature Request ?

## [Devlog](./docs/devlog.md)
### Latest Update 21/03/2022
I think most theme issues are closed and have just released a version which also fixes the auto updater. Please download 8.0.4a.

I'm thinking  about adding new themes to make Kuro even more customizable.
I'm thinking about removing the "Sepia" theme, but would like to have some insights on its usage before doing so.
Please provide feedback on the [issues](https://github.com/davidsmorais/kuro/issues) page ðŸš€
