## Description

Kuro is an unofficial, featureful, open source, community-driven, free Microsoft To-Do app, used by people in more than 120 countries.

Ao, the original project is [here](https://github.com/klaussinani/ao), and the last working release is can be found on [pythonInRelay's repo  releases page](https://github.com/pythonInRelay/ao/releases).

* **Do not request new package types**. You can submit the PR or an [issue](https://github.com/davidsmorais/kuro/issues) to have them built.

## Latest Update 18/01/2022

Since both of Ao's repos are no longer maintained (both by [pythonRelay](https://github.com/pythonInRelay/ao) & the [original](https://github.com/klaussinani/ao)). I decided to fork the latest working version of Ao and rebrand it into something that can actually be pushed the app stores in the Linux ecosystems.

I've fixed a few visual bugs and am working on a re-brand of Ao into Kuro. I'll change the logo and some more stuff inside the app.
