## Description

Ao is an unofficial, featureful, open source, community-driven, free Microsoft To-Do app, used by people in more than 120 countries.

The original repo is [here](https://github.com/klaussinani/ao), but seems to have been abandoned by the creator. My fork incorporates some of my own changes and pulls from other repos to fix themes and so on. I do not care for credits or otherwise and to abide by the original MIT license, I've left anything alone that needs not be changed.

* Releases can be found on my [releases page](https://github.com/pythonInRelay/ao/releases).
* **Do not request new package types**. You can submit the PR yourself to have them built.

Please check the original page readme for info about the application.
I will not be making any real readme changes except to keep track of updates.
