## Description

Ao is an unofficial, featureful, open source, community-driven, free Microsoft To-Do app, used by people in more than 120 countries.

The original repo is [here](https://github.com/klaussinani/ao), but seems to have been abandoned by the creator. My fork incorporates some of my own changes and pulls from other repos to fix themes and so on. I do not care for credits or otherwise and to abide by the original MIT license, I've left anything alone that needs not be changed.

Release packages (.deb, .snap, .appimage etc) including source build instructions can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/pythonInRelay/ao/releases).

Please check the original page readme for info about the application. I will not be making any real readme changes except to keep track of updates.
